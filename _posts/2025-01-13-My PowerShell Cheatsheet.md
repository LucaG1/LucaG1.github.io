## Getting help
```
help Get-Service
```
`Get-Help` is a bit unhandy as it scrolls down the help page.

```
<some_command_with_object_output> | Get-Member
```

Getting commands that accept a certain input type
```
Get-Command -ParameterType ServiceController
```

Brackets for passing output as paramters
```
Stop-Service -DisplayName (Get-Content -Path $env:TEMP\services.txt)
```

## History

Session history:

```
Get-History
```

Search full history:
```
Get-Content (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath | ? { $_ -like '*mlflow*' }
```
